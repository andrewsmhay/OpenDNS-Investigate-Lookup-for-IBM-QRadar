## Synopsis

This is a simple [OpenDNS Investigate](http://www.opendns.com/enterprise-security/solutions/investigate/) right-click integration for use within [IBM Security QRadar SIEM](http://www-03.ibm.com/software/products/en/qradar-siem) using the built-in <code>ip_context_menu.xml</code> file - located on the QRadar console in the <code>/opt/qradar/conf/</code> directory.

## Installation

1) Clone the repository locally or download the <code>ip_context_menu.xml</code> file.

2) Upload the <code>ip_context_menu.xml</code> file to your QRadar console.

<code>$ **scp ip_context_menu.xml root@*\<QRadar console IP\>*:.**</code>

3) Using SSH, log in to QRadar as the root user:

<code>$ **ssh root@\<QRadar console IP\>**</code>

4) Back up your existing  <code>ip_context_menu.xml</code> file:

<code>$ **mv /opt/qradar/conf/ip_context_menu.xml /opt/qradar/conf/ip_context_menu.xml.orig**</code>

5) Copy your new <code>ip_context_menu.xml</code> file into the configuration directory:

<code>$ **cp ~/ip_context_menu.xml /opt/qradar/conf/ip_context_menu.xml**</code>

*Note: Copy any previous settings from your original <code>ip_context_menu.xml</code> file into this new file, if required.*

6) Restart the tomcat service:

<code># **service tomcat restart**</code>
